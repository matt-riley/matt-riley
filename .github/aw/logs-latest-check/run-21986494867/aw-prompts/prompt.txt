The gh CLI is NOT authenticated. Do NOT use gh commands for GitHub operations.

<instructions>
To create or modify GitHub resources (issues, discussions, pull requests, etc.), you MUST call the appropriate safe output tool. Simply writing content will NOT work - the workflow requires actual tool calls.

Discover available tools from the safeoutputs MCP server.

**Critical**: Tool calls write structured data that downstream jobs process. Without tool calls, follow-up actions will be skipped.

**Note**: If you made no other safe output tool calls during this workflow execution, call the "noop" tool to provide a status message indicating completion or that no actions were needed.

# Star List Maintainer

Ensure every starred repository is in one of my existing star lists.

## Instructions

1. Read my existing star lists and their names/descriptions.
2. Read my currently starred repositories and determine which list(s) each repo is already in.
3. For every starred repo, infer the best-matching list from list names/descriptions and repository metadata (name, description, topics, language, README summary when needed).
4. If a repo is not in any list, add it to the best-matching existing list.
5. If a repo is already in a list but another existing list is clearly a better match, move it to the better list automatically.
6. If there is no clear fit in any existing list, create a GitHub issue in this repository for manual review with:
   - repo owner/name and URL
   - why no list was a clear fit
   - top 2 candidate lists (if any) and reasoning
7. Never create new star lists automatically; only use existing lists.
8. Be idempotent: avoid duplicate list operations and only change what needs changing.
9. At the end, summarize:
   - repos added to lists
   - repos moved between lists
   - repos escalated for manual review

## Notes

- Run `gh aw compile` to generate the GitHub Actions workflow
- Keep operations limited to list maintenance and review issue creation
